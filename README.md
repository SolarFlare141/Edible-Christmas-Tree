This mod was simply asked for in a comments section. so. here it is. I didn't wanna flood the nexus page, and I don't mod for money, so GitHub is just convenient.

Installation Instructions:
- Download It
- Select and copy all of it
- Go to the original mod's tree json and highlight everything
- Press CTRL + V. it should change a bit visibly. now just hit ctrl + s and it should work ingame.
